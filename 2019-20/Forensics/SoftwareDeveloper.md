# How to become a freelance developer

Hi, my name is Brett Bender, and I am from Rio High School. 12 years ago I discovered the wonderful world of computing, or at least I think so. I would've been 3 years old when I started playing video games, whether it be on a computer, or on our old PS1. It wasn't until 6 years later, that I would find the deep dark hole of programming. I started out with one of the most simplistic languages there are, then gradually over the past 6 years I learned more and more languages, dependent on the situation and the application I was developing. It wasn't until recently I became a freelance software developer, which is what I'm here to explain for you today.

Becoming a freelance developer can be very intimidating, and often requires an investment, whether it be economically or otherwise.
