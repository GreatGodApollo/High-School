# Participation Medals
A quick speech by Brett Bender

## Introduction
Participation medals have been debated for a very long time, whether or not they should be given out to *participants* of sports. According to many people, participation medals shouldn't be handed out for one specific reason, every other participant is going to have a medal, and as such it has near no value. At one point trophies and medals were only handed out to the true winners, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, but now at many events, you get one just for trying.

## Body #1 - My main opinion
A sport that has combatted participation medals in what I would say is the proper way, is Cross Country. At a Cross Country meet receiving a participation medal or ribbon is completely up to the meet host, and often times they don't hand them out. Instead Cross Country expects a certain level of excellence out of you, and at most competitions, this expectation is to be in the top 20. In this way not only does Cross Country leave handing out ribbons to the host, but it also allows the medals to hold value in a person's mind, knowing not everyone received one.

## Body #2 - Devil's Advocate
Of course, there will be people who argue for the other side, and to them, I say good for you. Many a student would say they want a medal, and that's the only reason they're in a sport, but in my opinion, I would prefer to have a medal that holds meaning in my mind. I have also seen parents complain about their student not receiving a participation ribbon, and every time somebody around them mentions that nobody else got one, and only the top 'x' medal.

## Conclusion
To conclude I believe that participation medals should not be handed out at sporting events, in this way a real medal can hold more value in the eyes of the athlete. Several psychologists have also found that these medals have little to no worth to an athlete when they receive one. As such, medals should only be handed out to the tip-top athletes who deserve to have one.
