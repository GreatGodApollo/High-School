# Entertaining: ParcelSafe

  We all order stuff online, and I'm sure we've all seen what mail handlers do with our packages. Are you tired of it? Try ParcelSafe.

  This all-new innovative invention not only protects your package during transport but also when it has been delivered to your door. It has many gizmos and gadgets all over in order to offer the best shielding against those moronic mailmen. With multiple capacitive touch sensors and accelerometers, you always know when it's moving. Along with those, its massive electro-magnets firmly attach it to your door, so you don't have to worry about anyone seizing your brand new doodads.

  And that's just the beginning of its feature list. If we move along we can discover it's many biometric security enhancements, not only does it scan your finger, it also scans your peepers to ensure it's really you. When we keep going down that list we also come to the in-transit protection. No, it's not just a bunch of bubble wrap, it's a bubble sheath. These sacks aren't your normal bubble wrap, they are gyroscopically stabilized, meaning at no point of time, will your package be upside down.

  With it's *basic* functions out of the way, let's get to the price. Now of course, this can't be a one time price, not even a two time price, instead it's a price that must be paid each and every time, you make an online purchase. After my economics team did some number crunching, I'm told that we can offer this for the mere price of $19.99 (+ shipping and handling). There is one string attached though, this price can only be offered if you return your ParcelSafe after use (if not returned within 9 business days extra fees may apply).
  
  So what do you say? Think once, think twice, think ParcelSafe when making your next order.
