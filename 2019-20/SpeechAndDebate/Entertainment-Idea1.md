# The real reason programmers exist

  We all can use computers *well*, or can we? What allows us to use them? The keyboard? The mouse? What about the monitor? My answer is none of those, in fact, it's not any of your standard ways of interfacing with a computer. No, instead there's a mini programmer that exists inside every single computer, predicting your every move, making the computer act the way you want to.

  Maybe that's a little overdramatized, but why do programmers even exist? If we made it so perfect the first time around, why are they still here? People are always finding ways to use software in ways it wasn't designed for, yet here we are, software developers sitting behind desks working on "code" that we didn't know needed to be worked on. 

  So what is the real reason they still exist? Because people, and I mean this in the kindest way possible, are idiots. Now just because we're idiots doesn't mean we're stupid.
