## 9.2.1 Big Ideas
- Cloud Cover: Quarters
  - Sirrus
  - Stratus
  - Cumulus
- Air masses
  - Polar
  - Continental
  - Maritime
  - Tropical
- Fronts
  - Cold Fronts (Spikey)
  - Warm Fronts (Circular)
  - Stationary (Opposite)
  - Occluded (Same)

## 9.2.2 Big Ideas
- Air Pressure
  - Cold air = dense; lower humidity potential
  - Warm air = less dense; higher humidity potential
- Pressure affects wind
  - Air moves from high pressure to low pressure
  - Higher the high pressure, lower the low pressure = stronger
  - Where the difference is less  = less wind
- Air pressure & Weather
  - Cool, Dry air = high pressure = clear weather
  - Warm, humid = low pressure = stormy weather

## 9.2.3 Big Ideas
- Technology used to collect weather data
  - Satellite
  - Doppler radar (measure/detect precipitation)
  - Radiosonde (device a weather balloon carries to measure atmospheric conditions) - up to the mesosphere
  - Airplane
  - Ground-weather station

- Weather Predicting
  - Based on current conditions, historical data, and physical laws and processes
  - Computer modeling used to input how changes to temperatures, water vapor, air pressure, and wind speed would affect current conditions
  - Prone to inaccuracies due to the dynamic Earth we live on with constantly changing variables.

- Wind barbs
  - Wind speed in knots
  - Long 10, Short 5, Flag/Triangle 50

- Severe Weather
  - Warning/Watches determined by National Weather Service
  - NWS run by the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA)
  - NOAA is under the Commerce department

- Isobar Maps
  - Base 4 (Every 4 for lines)
  - Start at either highest or lowest pressure
