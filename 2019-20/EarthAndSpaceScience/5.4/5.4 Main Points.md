# Unit 5.4 Review

## Exploration #1 Big Ideas
- **Big Bang Theory** - Universe expanded from a very hot, dense state around 13.8 bya
- **Progression of the Big Bang** - Protons, Neutrons & Electrons form but cannot combine - Protons & Neutrons combine to Neutral atoms form (P+N+E) - New elements form from within stars & supernova
- **Working Backwards** (tree fell over in woods) - Even though the event wasn't seen, scientists use evidence that is still available and try to explain why it could exist (**CBR**)

## Exploration #2 Big Ideas
- **Edwin Hubble Contributions** - Galaxies farther away from MWG were mostly redshifted and traveling faster than galaxies closer to MWG
  - Models demonstrating this: Balloon (mini-lab) & Raisin-Bread model

## Exploration #3 Big Ideas
- **Early Plasma universe** - Particles constantly colliding & photons can't escape, just being transferred from one particle to another
- **Opaque Universe** - Because light cannot escape and density is so great, the universe would be opaque
- As the universe cools, atoms & eventually elements form & eventually the universe becomes transparent
- **ONLY WHEN** Universe became transparent could light travel in all directions (which is why the earliest light from the Big Bang can never be seen)
- **CMB** - Remnant light emitted 380,000 years after the BB, found in all directions around the universe, keeps the universe just slightly above absolute freezing.
- **Ratio of H to He** - Should have been 3:1, however, need an undisturbed region of space to support. Regions have been found to support this.
