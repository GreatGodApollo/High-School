## Exploration 1
- Types of instruments used for observations
  - Ground-based telescope
    - Atmosphere gets in the way
  - Satellite
    - No atmosphere
  - Spacecraft
    - Probes
      - Can go to a planet
      - Can tell aliens that we exist
- Electromagnetic Spectrum
  - Short Wavelength = High Frequency/Energy (Gamma, X-ray)
  - Long Wavelength = Low Frequency/Energy (Radio, Microwaves)
  - Some Waves Get to Surface
    - Radio
    - Visible Light
    - Ultra Violet
    
## Exploration 2
- Doppler Effect in General (Sound)
- Doppler Effect in relation to Light
- RABT (Red Away Blue Towards)

## Exploration 3
- Spectra
  - Absorption Spectrum
    - Dark Lines
      - Absorbed by an element
  - Emission Spectrum
    - Bright lines
      - Emitted by an element
  - Continuous
    - Absorption and Emission combined
- Spectra in Relation to Atomic Energy
  - Photon = Energy
- What strengthens spectra lines?
  - Bigger Amounts
  - Having More

## Exploration 4
- Determining Motion
- Parallax
- Relationship between Color & temperature
  - Hotter the Brighter
  - Cooler = Red
  - Hotter = Blue
- Infared Radiation
  - Hotter = More
  - Cooler = Less
