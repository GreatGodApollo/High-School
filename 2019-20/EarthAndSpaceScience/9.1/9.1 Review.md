# Unit 9.1 Review
## Exploration 1
- Composition of Atmosphere
  - Elements: Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon
  - Compounds: Water vapor (considered variable gas, meaning it is going to be found sometimes in high concentrations (rain forest) and low concentrations (desert)), Carbon Dioxide
  - Solids (Aerosols): Dust & Pollen
- Layers of Atmosphere
  - Troposphere: Lowest layer, where most of the atmosphere air is located, where heat is going to be trapped from carbon dioxide
  - Stratosphere: Layer of Ozone (O3) that absorbs ultraviolet light which is why this layer increases in temperature.... more ozone = higher temperatures, less = lower
  - Mesosphere: Coldest temperatures in the atmosphere
  - Thermosphere - Where harmful solar radiation is absorbed
- Between each layer is a region of equal temperature called -pauses (Tropopause, etc.)
- Temperature zig-zags as altitude increases (Troposphere decreases, stratosphere increases, etc.)

## Exploration 2
- How the atmosphere interacts with other "spheres"
- Biosphere: Gas exchange of oxygen & carbon dioxide, nitrogen fixation, and denitrification, human-caused fossil fuel usage increases carbon dioxide gas
- Hydrosphere: Water Cycle
- Geosphere: Erosion & Weathering shaping the landscape; volcanoes erupting methane, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere.

## Exploration 3
- How the Earth is Heated:
  - More heat: most direct sunlight; largest angle (Equator = 90 degrees)
  - Less heat: less direct sunlight; smallest angle (Arctic = 5-10 degrees)
- Air flows from areas of high concentration (High Pressure) to areas of low concentration (Low Pressure)
- Warm Air: Less Dense
- Cold Air: More Dense
