# 5.2 Notes

## Exploration 1: Energy and the Sun
- All stars start when nuclear fusion begins
- Nuclear Fusion begins with Hydrogen-1, becoming Helium-4
- Steps: H-1 fuses into H-2 (or deuterium); H-2 fuses with another H-1 to form He-3; He-3 fuses with another He-3 to form He-4
- Layers of the Sun:
  - The core - Site of nuclear fusion (super hot and dense)
  - Radiative zone - Where heat from core ends up for long periods of time
  - Convection zone - Where heat from radiative zone creates convection effect (heat rising, cooler gases sinking)
  - Photosphere - Energy is released as Light Energy
  - Chromosphere - Visible during a solar eclipse
  - Corona - visible during a solar eclipse (super hot due to heat from magnetic field)
- Sunspots - Cooler areas caused by magnetic fields
- Solar wind - Protons and electrons being shot out from the sun into space
- Solar flares- realignment of the magnetic field causing the release of energy
- CME - Explosion of energy caused by a disturbance in the magnetic field

## Exploration 2: Properties of Stars
- Main star properties - Stellar Brightness, Temperature, Luminosity, Mass, and Size
- Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude
- H-R Diagram

## Exploration 3: Star-forming regions
- Interstellar medium
- Nebulas
- The process by which nebula becomes star

## Exploration 4: Matter Transformations in Stars
- Going beyond helium
  - Low mass stars (Yellow and Red dwarfs) don't go beyond oxygen
  - High mass stars (Blue giants) go all the way to iron
  - Low mass stars - MS to red giant to a white dwarf
  - High mass stars - MS to red supergiant to supernova to either a neutron star or a black hole
