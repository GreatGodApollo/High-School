  - Satellite
  - Weather Stations
  - Radar
  - Weather Balloons
  - Airplane
- Principles of the Doppler Effect
- Spectra
- Parallax
- How stars make energy (Nuclear fusion)
- Layers of the sun
  - Layers of the Sun:
  - The core - Site of nuclear fusion (super hot and dense)
  - Radiative zone - Where heat from core ends up for long periods of time
  - Convection zone - Where heat from radiative zone creates convection effect (heat rising, cooler gases sinking)
  - Photosphere - Energy is released as Light Energy
  - Chromosphere - Visible during a solar eclipse
  - Corona - visible during a solar eclipse (super hot due to heat from magnetic field)
- Stellar brightness (Apparent vs. Absolute)
- Relationship between color, temperature, and size of stars
- HR Diagram (Main Sequence stars = Fusing Hydrogen)
- Interstellar MEdium (The so-called empty parts of space)
- Birth & Death of Stars
- Evidence of Big Bang
  - Evidence from Hubble
  - Raisin-Bread Model
  - Properties of Early Universe (Opaque Universe)
  - Cosmic Microwave Background

## 4: Unit 9: Weather & Climate (39 Questions)
### The Atmosphere
- Structure of Atmosphere
  - Layers of Atmosphere
    - Troposphere: Lowest layer, where most of the atmosphere air is located, where heat is going to be trapped from carbon dioxide
    - Stratosphere: Layer of Ozone (O3) that absorbs ultraviolet light which is why this layer increases in temperature.... more ozone = higher temperatures, less = lower
    - Mesosphere: Coldest temperatures in the atmosphere
    - Thermosphere - Where harmful solar radiation is absorbed
  - Composition & Charactersitics
    - Elements: Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon
    - Compounds: Water vapor (considered variable gas, meaning it is going to be found sometimes in high concentrations (rain forest) and low concentrations (desert)), Carbon Dioxide
    - Solids (Aerosols): Dust & Pollen
- How Atmosphere interacts with other "spheres"
- How atmopshere moves and the consequences of that movement
  - How air is different under low and high pressure conditions
  - Coriolis effect

### Weather Prediction & Modeling
- Difference between weather & climate
- Continental vs. Maritime air masses
- Cold, Warm, Stationary, and Occluded Fronts
- How air pressure changes at altitude changes
- How humidity is tied to air pressure
- How changes in air pressure is tied to wind
- How air pressure is tied to local weather
- Technology used to forecast weather
- How modelling is used to forecast weather
- Weather symbols

### Climate Change
- Factors that influence climate
- Evidence of climate change
- Natural causes of climate change
  - Volcanoes, Orbital CHanges, Plate tectonics & Changes to atmospheric composition
- Effect on Human Civilization
- What can humans do?
