Prisons come in **three degrees of security**: Maximum, Medium, Minimum. The dangerousness of the prisoner determines where they serve their time. Violent offenders (Crimes against persons) usually get the maximum security assignment. Non-violent offenders are normally sent to a medium or minimum security.

Feliones are *serious* Crimes. *If* the sentence is **more** than a year, it is served in a *prison*, not a jail. Misdemeanors are *less serious* crimes, for which the sentence is *always less than a year*. Misdemeanors are served (if at all) in a county jail.

**Plea Bargaining** is the practice of *pleading guilty* in exchange for a *lesser sentence*. It saves time and energy for the government. ***90% of all court cases are plea bargained!***

The courts in the USA *divide* their time between **civil cases** and **criminal cases**. When necessary, criminal cases are scheduled first. This results in backlogged cases that sometimes stretch for a year.
